# CodeAlpha Java Internship – Project Portfolio

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains all the tasks and projects completed during my **CodeAlpha Java Internship**.  
Throughout the internship, I worked on multiple Java-based applications to strengthen my understanding of **core Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data handling, and application design**.

Each project focuses on solving a real-world problem using Java and follows clean coding practices.
